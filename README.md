# My UoPeople Journey

## A Website with the courses I have done so far with University of the People and my experiences and tips on each course I have done.

As a CS student, I found myself interested in learning a lot of what would help me understand and use the skills taught at the University of the People. I studied lots of other things outside my official courses but still in relation to the pursuit in my program. I knew that I need that extra bit to be able to cover what was necessary for me to be ready for the job market in a short time. 
Here, I have courses I did at the University (and also some other courses I independently studied) to make up for the time and the speed. 

## Visuals 
To place some images here....

## User Instructions
Please visit the site at http://www..... . On the Home page, you will access the courses I have done so far with links to other pages such as where somethings about the course are given and also some tips and personal experiences.

## Developer Instructions
This is open source. Clone the project or fork it and use it to create your own courses page or some other thing that you would want to design in a similar fashion. 

### Find a bug?
If any bug is found, please suggest correction solutions and make a PR detailing what changes you have done. This will help improve this project; and for that I will be grateful. 

## Known Issues
Here is a list of issues that I have found and I have not fixed them yet.


## Buy me a coffee
Link up with me to support me in my course and growth as a programmer. I need lots of mentors to guide me,especially into the world of AI and ML algorithms. 


# Technologies Used

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
